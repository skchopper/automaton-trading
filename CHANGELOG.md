# MEAT — Mortality Engineered Auto-Trading

**Changelog / release notes.** Paper trading by default; live trading is triple-gated.
Not investment advice.

Machine identifiers (`@local/automaton-trading`, plugin id `automaton-trading`, the
`automaton_*` tools, `automaton-data/`, `automaton.config.json`, `.env`, `bin/automaton.mjs`)
are intentionally unchanged in this release so the installed plugin, the running paper loop and
existing state migrate with **zero** data changes.

---

## v2.2.0 (unreleased) — trading-hours-only monitoring + two execution tiers

- **Price monitoring now runs only during trading hours.** `engine.tradingHoursOnly: true` makes the
  loop read the broker clock every cycle; outside RTH it runs a cheap maintenance pass (no market
  data, no prospector/builder/executor, no per-cycle charges) and only the research sidecar + status
  snapshot, then sleeps `engine.offHoursIntervalSec` (default 300 s) instead of the 60 s trading
  tick. Orders were already blocked off-hours by brake D3; this also stops paying data/metabolism
  costs while nothing can trade.
- **Two per-bot execution tiers.** Genesis assigns alternating `tier: day|swing`; children inherit
  their parent's tier (never mutated by a birth). `cadence.day` (default every 60 s on 1-minute
  bars) fully analyses/trades day-trading bots; `cadence.swing` (default every 3600 s on 1-hour
  bars) runs mid/long-term bots. Each tier evaluates bar-based rules on its own timeframe lane.
- **Safety between swing decisions:** a non-due swing bot that holds a position still gets an
  **exit-only risk pass** every cycle (stop/target/max-hold/research-ALERT), so positions are never
  left unmanaged for an hour; it cannot open new positions outside its cadence.
- **Config/status:** new `cadence` block + `engine.tradingHoursOnly/offHoursIntervalSec`
  validation; status adds per-agent `tier` and `cadence {intervalSec, timeframe, lastAnalysisAt,
  nextAnalysisAt}` plus `engine.cadence/tradingHoursOnly`. Existing agents are backfilled
  alternating tiers on first start; removing the `cadence` block restores legacy single-cadence
  behaviour.
- Tests: `control` +3 (cadence config validation, day-vs-swing scheduling with cold start/hour
  boundary, closed-market maintenance pass asserting no executions and no cycle charges) →
  **227 tests across 8 suites**.
- Docs: `docs/RUNBOOK.md` §8b (tiered cadence + trading-hours gate, tuning and revert), README.
- Upgrade: restart the Harness app so the engine reloads config; press Start (auto-start off).

## v2.1.0 (unreleased) — fast intraday profile (minute monitoring)

- **1-minute decision loop for the paper population:** `cycleIntervalSec: 60`, `data.timeframe: "1Min"`,
  `data.feed: "iex"`, `lookbackBars: 120`, `risk.maxDailyOrders: 12`. The engine now re-prices the whole
  population every minute during the session instead of every 5 minutes.
- **Hold rules are timeframe-correct:** `maxHoldBars` is measured in bars of the configured timeframe
  (1-minute bars = minutes), so a 12-bar time stop is 12 minutes on the fast profile. The dashboard agent
  plan states the bar duration; the previous code always treated a bar as one hour.
- **Data feed is configurable and validated:** `data.feed` is `iex` (real-time during RTH, free) or
  `sip` (consolidated, 15-min delayed on the free plan); `data.timeframe` is allow-listed. Bars and
  quotes for the orchestrator, executor and prospector all use the configured feed.
- **Trade-offs documented in `docs/RUNBOOK.md` §8a:** IEX is a single venue and sparse outside regular
  hours; minute bars are noisier for strategy specs originally compiled on hourly data; cycle costs
  scale ~5x with the faster loop; the free plan cannot provide true real-time SIP reaction. Revert to
  `1Hour` + `300` for the previous cadence.
- Tests: `control` suite +4 (timeframe→bar math, config allow-list, timeframe-aware hold/plan, 1-minute
  profile boot) → **224 tests across 8 suites**.

## v2.0.0 — 2026-10-29

First public release after the initial code upload. Renamed the project, app and plugin to
**MEAT — Mortality Engineered Auto-Trading**, and added the full operator control plane and the
per-agent research analyst on top of the mortality engine.

### Renamed to MEAT
- Project/app/plugin display name is now **MEAT — Mortality Engineered Auto-Trading**
  (Harness plugin title and locale, sidebar panel header, README, docs, CLI banner).
- GitHub repository renamed to [`skchopper/meat`](https://github.com/skchopper/meat) (the old
  `automaton-trading` URL redirects).
- Internal ids stay stable for zero-downtime upgrade (see note above); the package version is
  bumped to **2.0.0**.

### New: per-agent isolated research analyst (hourly news → trading decisions)
- Each living bot gets its **own** LLM briefing about **its own** holdings and news from the
  Alpaca News API, with a private journal — no other bot's book, no other role's memory.
- Briefing schema: sentiment, confidence, verdict (`HOLD`/`AVOID`/`ALERT`), catalysts, risks,
  summary, timestamped sources; stored per agent in `automaton-data/research/<agentId>.jsonl`.
- **Live influence (advisory only):** fresh briefings can veto a new entry (`research_veto`),
  shrink the order size (never increase it), or force an exit (`research_alert`). Every order
  still passes all 14 hard brakes; the analyst has no order or wallet access.
- **Agent-paid:** `$0.001` per successful briefing is charged to that bot's ledger
  (category `research`), so research shortens its own runway. Failed/malformed replies are free.
- **Cadence is operator-selectable from the panel:** every 1 h / 3 h / 6 h / 24 h,
  **before market open**, **after market close**, or both. Applies live
  (`POST /automaton/control {action:'set-research-settings'}`) and is persisted in
  `automaton-data/settings.json` so it survives restarts.
- Hardened after live incidents: JSON repair + one retry for malformed model replies, provider
  error backoff (15 min, 1 h for fatal errors such as an exhausted API balance), stale briefings
  ignored by trading, and a corrected veto rule so risk lists shrink orders instead of blocking
  every entry.

### New: operator control panel (Harness sidebar)
- **Research cadence** controls (above), collection/influence toggles, next-due time,
  provider/model and pause reason.
- **Rewards control:** enable toggle, period (daily/weekly/monthly), and 1st/2nd/3rd percentages
  of the broker account's **cash** — defaults **+5% / +3% / +2%** — optional per-period maximum,
  live preview against the treasury pool and allocation-cap headroom, last winners and history.
  Payouts are **virtual treasury→agent ledger transfers** at period boundaries only, once per
  period, floored to cents and proportionally capped by pool / allocation cap / max. No broker
  transfer surface exists, so reconciliation is unchanged.
- **Leaderboards:** daily, weekly and monthly rankings of all bots by period P&L %, medals for the
  top 3, click-through to the agent detail.
- **Richer agent detail page:** strategy explanation, exact entry rule, exit rules (stop/target/
  time/signal), risk rule, plan + next step, trigger grid, current position plan (stop/target/bars
  held), P&L (realized/unrealized/day/week/month), ranking badges, next research time, research
  briefing, and a full **transactions** table (time/side/symbol/qty/price/notional/realized/order id).
- Both settings are validated with an allow-list in the Host (500-level errors kept structured,
  `400 INVALID_SETTINGS` on bad input), are loopback-only operator routes, and are **never**
  exposed as agent tools.

### Reliability and correctness fixes since the initial upload
- **Async Alpaca fills:** market orders return `accepted` before filling; the executor now polls
  briefly for the real fill and reconciles every filled broker order per agent, so a fill can no
  longer be lost or booked as a 0-qty ledger rejection.
- **State persistence:** atomic JSON writes retry transient Windows file-lock races; a successful
  cycle clears a stale `lastError`; the external Reaper now persists registry/ledger **only when a
  sweep kills an agent** (single-writer discipline), fixing lost-update races.
- **Harness LLM bridge:** dispatch now echoes the prepared frozen call config (adapter defaults
  included), fixing `INVALID_PREPARED_CALL`; provider/model are recorded per briefing; the research
  output budget is 1200 tokens.
- Research-gate tuning: veto only on explicit `AVOID`/`ALERT` or sentiment ≤ −0.6; risk lists apply
  a size penalty instead of vetoing (a live mis-tune had vetoed 100% of entries).
- Paper loop now runs 30 bots × $20 on the $2,000 Alpaca paper account, with an external Reaper
  enforcing death, replication with exactly one mutation, and obituaries as inherited data.

### Documentation & verification
- New docs: `docs/RESEARCH.md` (research sidecar contract), `docs/CONTROL-PANEL.md`
  (operator panel / rankings / rewards contract); updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `docs/CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/VERIFICATION.md`.
- **8 test suites, 220 tests, all passing:** mortality 55, market 27, plugin 40, integration 21,
  security 41, research 13, rankings 16, control 7 — plus `scripts/research-smoke.mjs` 10/10 and
  `scripts/verify-fixes.mjs` 18/18.
- Safety invariants covered by the security suite: no transfer/withdraw surface, live gating
  (`mode`+`allowLive`+`LIVE_ARMED`), kill switch, one-way death, hard population cap, and no engine
  control over the Reaper.

### Upgrade notes
1. Restart the DeepSeek Harness app to load the new Host engine + panel (Host plugin modules are
   ESM-cached). The sidebar panel will show the MEAT title, cadence control, rewards card,
   leaderboards and expanded agent detail.
2. The paper loop does not auto-start (`engine.autoStart: false`): press **Start** in the panel.
3. Research needs LLM credit in the Harness-configured DeepSeek account (top up if it is empty);
   without it, research pauses and trading continues without research influence.
4. Run `node packages/automaton-trading/bin/automaton.mjs probe` after any config change to verify
   Alpaca connectivity without placing orders.

### Known limitations
- The panel is operator-only and requires the Harness app to be running; research/trading stop when
  the PC/app is off (no cloud deployment).
- Reward percentages are capped by the shared treasury pool and the 80% allocation cap; on a
  $2,000 account the default 5/3/2% daily schedule is intentionally generous and will hit those
  caps over time — lower the percentages or choose weekly/monthly for longevity.
- Live UI verification of the new panel happens after the Host restart (engine tests and plugin
  mapping tests are green before it).
